# ODINv2 - Open Source Command and Control Information System (C2IS)

ODINv2 is the successor of [ODINv1](https://github.com/syncpoint/ODIN). ODIN has been completely rewritten and enables a wide range of new features such as layer-level links and styles, searchable `#tag`s for features, layers, symbols, etc.

Replication in a distributed command and control environment is next on the roadmap. This capability will be reserved for Enterprise-Plan subscribers. ODIN as a standalone version remains open source.

## Migration from ODINv1

ODINv2 will migrate all of your existing ODINv1 projects on first start. You will be able to further use ODINv1 in parallel but we will not update newly or updated projects after the first start of ODINv2. If you do have any 
ODINv1 layer files (*.json) you can import them at any time via drag&drop onto the ODINv2 map.
