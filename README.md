# ODINv2 - Open Source Command and Control Information System (C2IS)

ODINv2 is the successor of [ODINv1](https://github.com/syncpoint/ODIN). ODIN has been completely rewritten and enables a wide range of new features such as layer-level links and styles, searchable `#tag`s for features, layers, symbols, etc.

Replication in a distributed command and control environment is next on the roadmap. This capability will be reserved for Enterprise plan subscribers. ODIN as a standalone version remains open source.
