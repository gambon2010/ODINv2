MILITARY AND GENERIC FEATURES STYLES

Requirement - ef5f457a-559f-4be3-b7a0-2bd5082ef8ce
  Different graphics require differing styles for line primitives.
  Example 1: COUNTER ATTACK for example renders lines as dashed,
  whereas most other graphics would show solid lines at the same time.
  Example 2: TASKS / FOLLOW AND ASSUME even uses solid and dashed line styles
  at the same time.

Requirement - 80da929f-f891-4635-b957-0b22e5c9a22c
  Geometry used for rendering might depend on resolution.
  Example 1: Spikes for STRONG POINT should have roughly the same length
  independent of zoom factor.
  Example 2: Spikes for STRONG POINT might be omitted for certain zoom factors.

Corollary - 852936ca-b3a5-4a68-91ef-b817e58bf6d8
  From requirements ef5f457a-559f-4be3-b7a0-2bd5082ef8ce and
  80da929f-f891-4635-b957-0b22e5c9a22c follows that vector layer for military
  features cannot be styled by a static/global style (array), but by a style function.

Definition - Defining Geometry
  Geometry used to define a feature.
  Example 1: STRONG POINT is defined by a single polygon geometry, but to render
  its spikes, additional geometries are necessary.

Definition - Simplified Geometry
  Defining line or polygon geometry which is simplified depending on resolution
  or other factors.
  Example 1: A polygon with thousands of points should be simplified.

Definition - Style Geometry (or Render Geometry)
  Optional style information used to render a feature.
  When provided, style geometry is usually derived from defining geometry or
  simplified geometry.  One feature may have multiple geometries styled differently,
  see requirement ef5f457a-559f-4be3-b7a0-2bd5082ef8ce, example 2.
  Style geometry is omitted if defining/simplified geometry is used directly as is.

Requirement - c7029184-bb26-4da9-9cd1-f5d7a183ea37
  For generic features, no style geometries should be supported.
  I.e. no differing styles for primitives are supported for a single feature.

Requirement - f56fb4b4-40fa-4ec4-a204-4e68762675ab
  Generic features may be styled with the following information:
  * Strokes: One or more stroke styles with different colors, widths, dash options, etc.
  * Optional fill color or pattern for polygons
  * Texts: zero, one or more texts with declarative or absolute positioning
  * Optional image with absolute point position

Constraint - b4985e0e-2e67-4c65-9ebe-1e88e4f75d2b
  GeoJSON format has no means to store or transport style information.

Requirement - 48e7b0b3-c791-480f-b95c-6384d5781f10
  For performance reasons geometries with many points may be simplified.
  See definition Simplified Geometry.

Requirement (QUESTIONABLE) - dc327c97-042b-4fca-af1f-49dcba58f052
  Military feature layers can be exported in GeoJSON format.

Corollary - 84190a2d-6e85-4296-8f80-6899274e6f2e
  From the definition of style geometry and constraint b4985e0e-2e67-4c65-9ebe-1e88e4f75d2b
  follows that GeoJSON geometry must be the feature's defining geometry.
  Would style geometry be stored/transported with GeoJSON, different styles would
  also be necessary, which GeoJSON cannot convey.

Corollary - b323298e-3ffd-4431-ba6d-07694b898b99
  From requirement dc327c97-042b-4fca-af1f-49dcba58f052 follows that the defining
  geometry must be stored.
